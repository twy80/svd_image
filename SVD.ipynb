    "# A concise explanation of SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVD of a matrix $A$ is the factorization of $A$ into the product of three matrices $A = UDV^T$, where the columns of $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal and the matrix $D$ is diagonal with nonnegative real entries. This decomposition can also be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\sum_{k=1}^{r} \\sigma_k u_k v_k^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the singular value $\\sigma_k$ is the $k$-th element of $D$ arranged in decending order, and $u_k$ and $v_k$ are the $k$-th columns of $U$ and $V$. The approximation of $A$ can thus be obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{A} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\sigma_k u_k v_k^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n (\\le r)$ is the rank of the compressed matrix $\\tilde{A}$. If $A$ contains pixels of an image, $\\tilde{A}$ is a compressed image using a reduced amount of memory. This is what is meant by image compression via SVD.\n"
